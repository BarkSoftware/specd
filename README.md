SETUP
=====
It's just a rails app, but you'll need to do a few things to get setup.
- Register a Github application.  You'll need the client id and secret setup as environment variables. (see settings.yml)
- Create an S3 bucket and setup CORS for the domain you'll be hosting on. (see settings.yml again)
- Set all the required environment variables, again see settings.yml
- Change database.yml if needed.
